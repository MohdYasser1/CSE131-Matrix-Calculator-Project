# CSE131-Matrix-Calculator-Project
 This is a matrix calculator that can preform simple operations on two matrices

## Day 1:
...Initialized the matrices and implemented how to take them from the user.

**Done**:
 - how to take the dimensions of both matrices.
 - how to enter the values of both matrices.
 - the message to choose the operation and the quitting message.

**ToDo**:
- Function for Adding/Subracting two matrix.
- A case system to take the operation and get it to the function.

**New Varibles**:
- rA (int) : row of matrix A
- rB (int) : row of matrix B
- cA (int) : column of Matrix A
- cB (int) : column of Matrix B
- MatA (array of int) : An array that holds the values of Matrix A
- MatB (array of int) : An array that holds the values of Matrix B
