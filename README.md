# CSE131-Matrix-Calculator-Project
 This is a matrix calculator that can preform simple operations on two matrices

## Day 1:
Initialized the matrices and implemented how to take them from the user.

### Done:
 - how to take the dimensions of both matrices.
 - how to enter the values of both matrices.
 - the message to choose the operation and the quitting message.

### ToDo:
- Function for Adding/Subracting two matrix.
- A case system to take the operation and get it to the function.

### New Varibles:
- rA (int) : row of matrix A
- rB (int) : row of matrix B
- cA (int) : column of Matrix A
- cB (int) : column of Matrix B
- MatA (array of int) : An array that holds the values of Matrix A
- MatB (array of int) : An array that holds the values of Matrix B

## Day 2:
Finished 3 funtions which adds, subtracts and multiplies 2 matrices.

### Problems Finished
1. Problem A ✅
2. Problem B ✅
3. Problem C ✅
4. Problem D
5. Problem E
6. Problem F
7. Problem G
8. Problem H
9. Problem I

#### Done:
- A function that adds 2 matrices
- A function that subtracts 2 matrices
- A function that multiply 2 matrices
- Case system that directs to each of the funtion
- Fail system if the the operation isn't allowed on the given dimensions

### ToDo:
- Learn how to get the determinant of matrix of different dimentions
- A function that gets the determinant of a matrix

### New Variables

**Add (function):** A functions that adds 2 matrices of the same dimention and then display the sum on the screen.

<u>Takes:</u>
- A (array): The first matrix
- B (array): The second matrix
- row (int): The numbers of rows of one of the 2 matrices(as the number of rows of both are the same).
- col (int): The numbers of columns of one of the 2 matrices(as the number of columns of both are the same).

add (array): An array that stors the sum of the two matrices to be later printed of the screen

**Sub (function):** A functions that adds 2 matrices of the same dimention and then displays the diffrence on the screen.

<u>Takes:</u>
- A (array): The first matrix
- B (array): The second matrix
- row (int): The numbers of rows of one of the 2 matrices(as the number of rows of both are the same).
- col (int): The numbers of columns of one of the 2 matrices(as the number of columns of both are the same).

sub (array): An array that stors the diffrence of the two matrices to be later printed of the screen

**Mult (funtion):** A function that multiplies 2 matrices if the dimentions accepts for multiplication and displays the product matrix on the screen.

<u>Takes:</u>
- A (array): The first matrix
- B (array): The second matrix
- rA (int) : row of matrix A
- rB (int) : row of matrix B
- cA (int) : column of Matrix A
- cB (int) : column of Matrix B

sum (int): A varible to display each cell of the matrix which represents the sum of products to be then displayed on the screen.
